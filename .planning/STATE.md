# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-23)

**Core value:** Operators can define, extend, and trust data-generation pipelines through uploadable UDFs, richer transforms, and an automated test harness.
**Current focus:** Planning next milestone (`/gsd-new-milestone`)

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-06-23 — Milestone v2.0 started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (v1.0):**

- Phases: 5
- Plans: 18
- Commits (milestone range): 46
- Timeline: 2026-06-17 → 2026-06-23

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v1 quality-first: harness before feature breadth — **shipped**
- Multi-form UDF with unified registry — **shipped**
- P0 regression gate (7 rows) — **shipped**
- Orchestration/RW/datasource deferred to v2

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Boot 4 / internal Kafka-ES starter compatibility (see `.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md`)
- Console RBAC default-off for external deployments
- No formal milestone audit before v1.0 close (accepted)
